# Cargo Integration

> #### IMPORTANT: #
> [Helium Cargo](http://cargo.helium.com/) is an evaluation tool and the data collected is available to all developers. Please do not share any sensitive information. Use at your own discretion.

## Add a Cargo Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left menu. Select the integration to add - in this case, the **Cargo** integration.  

The next step is to name the integration.  

Last, apply any optional Labels. For more information on Labels please visit the [Labels guide](/console/labels).  

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration
with a device. To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the same label to both the device and integration.
Labels need to be created before attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](/console/labels).

## Cargo Endpoint

The Cargo endpoint is where device data is sent if connected with a Label.

**HTTP Details**  
Method: `post`  
Endpoint: `https://cargo.helium.com/api/payloads`  
Headers: `{"Content-Type":"application/json"}` 


## Cargo Payload

The Cargo payload defines the content and structure of the data payload that must be sent to the cargo endpoint from a device or separate application.

**Total Payload:** 
  * 12 Bytes without Battery Voltage
  * 14 Bytes with Battery Voltage

**Packed in the following order:** 
* int32_t Latitude in Degrees
* int32_t Longitude in Degrees
* int16_t Elevation in Meters
* int16_t Speed in mph
* uint16_t Battery Voltage (Optional)

#### Example:
```
if (GPS.hasFix) { 
    idx = 0;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.latitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.longitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;    
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (int)(GPS.altitude);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;    
    data = (int)(GPS.speed);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
}    
```
