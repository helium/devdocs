# The Helium Console

The <a href="http://console.helium.com/" target="_blank">Helium Console</a> is a web-based device management tool hosted by Helium that allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage their devices on the Helium Network. In addition to device management, Console provides prebuilt connections called Channels to route device data via HTTPs or MQTT; or directly to cloud services like AWS IoT, GCP IoT, and Azure IoT.

Device Management includes:
- Organization structure with projects and subproject, and user-level permissions
- Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
- Data Credits (purchasing and payments) to Hotspots for utilizing the Helium Network


**Note: In order for device packet data to route to the internet, you'll need to be within range of the Helium Network. To check if there is coverage in your area, view our <a href="https://network.helium.com" target="_blank">coverage map</a>.**
