# Console - Routing Data

> #### IMPORTANT:  
> The cost per packet is $0.00001 USD (24 byte packets) which is equivalent to 1 Data Credit (DC).
> During the Beta there is no cost to send packets.

When a valid data packet is received from that device, a dot will appear from the left side of the chart and flow towards the right as time goes on.

Blue dots represent packets that have been successfully sent to endpoints, while orange dots have failed to reach an endpoint, and red dots do not have a defined endpoint.

The size of the dot is related to the size of the packet. Larger sized packets will be a larger dot, and small data packets will be a smaller dot.

> #### IMPORTANT: 
> Data is not stored in the Console so the Console window must be open in order to view live packets.

### Event Log
Event Logs display real-time packets in table form. See which Hotspot received the packet, its RSSI, and the size of the packet.

Follow these instructions to use the Console to set up a Channel to route data. A Helium Channel is a pre-built, secure connection from Helium-enabled devices straight through to a configured endpoint. When data arrives from a device, the Helium routing infrastructure ensures delivery of your encrypted data.


## Add an HTTP Channel

To add a channel, go to **Channels** on the left menu. Select the channel to add - in this case, the **HTTP** channel.

The next step is to paste the HTTP endpoint.

If you're still testing, you can find popular sites that can create HTTP endpoints for you and inspect packets. <a href="https://www.requestbin.com">Requestbin </a> and <a href="https://www.beeceptor.com">Beeceptor </a>provide tools to make an HTTP endpoint quickly and easily.

To transfer data to request bin continue with the example below. However, if you want to trigger services with device data go [here](/console/ifttt-pubnub).

### Requestbin Example
Create an endpoint by going to requestbin.com and click **Create a Request Bin**. Once created, copy the endpoint.

<img src={request_bin} />

... and paste it in Console.

<img src={pasted_endpoint} />

**HTTP Header** and **Value** are not required and those can be left blank. 

Lastly, provide a name for the channel. Names do not have to be unique.

Click **Create Channel**.

Your new channel is now ready for use.

## LongFi Packet Payload 

The example applications we have provided will send a JSON package similar to the example below: 

```
{
    "device_id": 37,
    "fingerprint": 3316710589,
    "gateway": "glorious turquoise tuna",
    "oui": 1,
    "payload": "WgIDBAUGBwg=",
    "rssi": -98,
    "sequence": 89,
    "snr": 11.5,
    "spreading": "SF10",
    "timestamp": 1575312819
}
```

<img src={example_payload} />

* **device_id** : Device ID associated with client device. 
* **fingerprint** : Mechanism for device and Routers to determine validity of datagram received. It resembles a HMAC, but the message cannot be supplied in the clear. Instead, a hash of the message is used. 
* **gateway** : name of the Hotspot that received LongFi packet. 
* **oui** : Organizational Unique Identifier that is used to determine which Router to deliver the datagram. 
* **payload** : base64 encoded version of the byte array 
* **rssi** : Received Signal Strength Indicator, an estimate mesaure of power level that the client device is receiving from a Helium Hotspot. 
* **sequence** : Mapping of ordering of byte stream. 
* **snr** : Difference between received wireless signal and the noise floor, or erroneous background transmissions that are emitted from either other devices that are too far away for the signal to be intelligible, or by devices that are inadvertently creating interference on the same frequency. 
* **spreading** : Duration of the chirp. LoRa operates with spread factors from 7 to 12, where SF7 is the shortest time on air and SF12 is the longest. Each step up in the spreading factor will double the time on air to transmit the same amount of data. 
* **timestamp** : Timestamp in Unix epoch time. 

##
### Set Multiple Channels
Devices can send the same data packet to multiple channels at once. This is a cost-effective way to send the same information to many places at once without re-sending the data from the IoT device.

To send to another channel, click **Connect Channel**, select a channel, and click **Add**.

### Set Default Channel 
[setchannel]: #setchannel

To set a channel as the default for all newly created devices, go to **Channels** on the left menu and click **Set Default** for the desired channel. 

<img src={set_channel_as_default} />

### Channel Details 
View the details of your channel by clicking on the Channel name. 

**Channel Details** shows the channel ID that is unique to each channel, the name, the type of channel, and whether it is active or ont.

**HTTP Details** shows the specific endpoint. Editing endpoints is not available in the SDK Beta and will be coming soon. If you no longer want to use a channel, simply create a new one and redirect existing devices using the old channel to use the new one.

**Devices Piped** lists all the devices that are currently sending their data to the selected channel.

**Update Channel** allows you to update your HTTP connection details for the currently viewed channel. 

## Data Credits

Data Credits are used to pay for data packets on the Helium Network. To acquire data credits, one would need to burn Helium Network Tokens (HNT) to get data credits.

Alternatively, Console provides the ability to purchase data credits without HNT.

**During the SDK Beta, all data packet transmission is free**
