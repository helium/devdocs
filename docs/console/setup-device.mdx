# Console - Device Setup

## Objective

This device setup guide will cover how to: 

* Register an account on Helium Console 
* Add a device to Helium Console and record device details 

## Create an account

To register for an account, visit <a href="https://console.helium.com" target="_blank">Helium Console</a> and click **Register**.

During Registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name and a Team name.

Define an Organization name for the top level owner of the account (ie: company name). Think of Teams as a way to organize groups of devices.

### Confirm your account
A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an account. You must confirm the account in order to continue using Console. If you did not receive an email, please check your spam folders.

## Device Management

Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers to load onto their device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device for the Helium Network.

### Add a Device

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+** icon on the bottom right of the window.

<img src={create_device} />

When prompted, enter a name for your device. Names do not have to be unique as every device has a unique device identifier.

> ##### Important!  
> Make sure you record the `AppEui` and `AppKey`, which will be needed when you program your device. 

All you need to do is update the AppEui, DevEui, and AppKey. AppEui and AppKey are provided from Helium Console after you've created your device:

 <img src={Device_Details} />  

Copy the information into the sketch:

```
static const u1_t PROGMEM APPEUI[8]= { 0x28, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
void os_getArtEui (u1_t* buf) { memcpy_P(buf, APPEUI, 8);}

static const u1_t PROGMEM APPKEY[16] = { 0xCC, 0x7C, 0xD6, 0x15, 0xA3, 0xCB, 0x9B, 0x5A, 0x3B, 0x55, 0x9B, 0x49, 0x3F, 0x92, 0x43, 0x79 };
void os_getDevKey (u1_t* buf) {  memcpy_P(buf, APPKEY, 16);}
```

Note that you can must put some arbitrary data into DevEui; you can use this later in your applications to identify certain settings:

```
static const u1_t PROGMEM DEVEUI[8]= {0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED, 0xFF, 0xFF };
void os_getDevEui (u1_t* buf) { memcpy_P(buf, DEVEUI, 8);}
```

Now that we've added a device on Console, let's build our device! 

We've curated an Arduino quickstart guide for you to follow, which you can access directly below.
