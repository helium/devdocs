# The Helium Network 

#### The Helium Network is the world’s first peer-to-peer wireless network made for connecting long range, low power devices. It’s built to address the massive connectivity gap needed to enable what’s estimated to be a more-than $1.4 trillion IoT market. 

> ##### The Network is Live
>The Helium Network officially went live on July 29, 2019 and is growing quickly across the United States (and soon the world). 

This documentation is intended to be a mostly-technical overview of the Helium Network and the hardware, software, and protocols that make it possible. That said, it’s not an exhaustive review and those that are looking for full details on things like algorithms will need to refer to the open source code that powers the Helium Network and relevant research papers.
