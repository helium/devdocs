# Helium Devices 

The Helium Network was built to transfer device data. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! 

Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it uses the [LoRaWAN wireless protocol](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan).
