# LoRaWAN Versions
Currently, [RouterV3](https://github.com/helium/routerv3) is LoRaWAN 1.0.2 compatible. We plan to make it 1.0.3, 1.0.4, and 1.1 compatible in the future.

# Routing & Authentication

Currently, devices with arbitrary AppEUI and DevEUI can use the Helium Network only as long as they authenticate using Over-the-Air-Authentication (OTAA). After OTAA, a DevAddr is assigned which allows for routing on the Helium Network. Read more about this [here](/longfi/longfi-routing).

# Roaming

Despite multiple Network Servers working on the LongFi Network (as opposed to a traditional LoRaWAN network), the DevAddr space is arbitrated such that roaming from one Helium hotspot to another provides seamless connection without subsequent joins.

# Subbands

Helium operates on sub-band 7 (Channels 48-55, 911.9-913.3 MHz). RouterV3 will send a MAC ADR command with the appropriate submask until confirmation from the device. These are sent during the receive windows after Data uplinks. 

Generally, this will work well with stacks that implement the full LoRaWAN specification. That is to say, devices should send Join requests on all 64 channels. 

They may, however, be biased towards a certain sub-band (preferably 7), such that their first attempt is on one of the 8 channels of that preferred subband.

After a successful Join, the devices should also be transmitting Data frames on all 64 channels; similarly, biasing towards subband 7 is preferable. This will allow them to eventually transmit and then receive the MAC ADR command on a Helium subband and thus receive the channel mask update.

Unfortunately, many devices do not use all 64 channels and will constraint themselves to a programmed sub-band. These devices will require a firmware update to join the Helium network.

In the future, we plan to be 1.1 compatible and to thus implement CFList in the JoinResponse.

# Adaptive Data Rate

Other than for configuring channel mask, Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithms are not implemented on RouterV3. This means that the configuration of your device is responsible for configuring itâ€™s own Spreading Factor (SF), which has implications on data costs.

# Receive Windows

RouterV3 implements the typical receive windows.

On Join request:
* Receive Window 1 = 5 seconds
* Receive Window 2 = 6 seconds

On Data Confirmed/Unconfirmed:
* Receive Window 1 = 1 second
* Receive Window 2 = 2 seconds
