# Helium Network 

The Helium Network is the largest, public LPWAN in the United States. It exists to route data for LoRaWAN-enabled devices. You can view [a live coverage map and network statistics here](https://network.helium.com/coverage).

Hotspots run a traditional LoRaWAN packet forwarder, similar to [the one from Semtech](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder).

Rather than forward to a centralized Network Server, however, the packet is forwarded to the [Helium Miner](https://github.com/helium/miner), which will query the blockchain records to determine the Organization Unique Identifier (OUI) of the device (see [Routing on LongFi](/longfi/longfi-routing)).

The OUI record provides the address of where the deviceâ€™s Network Server exists. The Miner will broker the packet micro-transaction with the Network Server. Assuming the transaction is made, the LoRaWAN packet is delivered to the Network Server.
