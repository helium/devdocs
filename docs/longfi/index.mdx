## Helium Network 

The Helium Network is the largest, public LPWAN in the United States. It exists to route data for LoRaWAN-enabled devices. You can view a [live coverage map and network statistics here](https://network.helium.com). 

## Helium blockchain 

The [Helium blockchain](/blockchain) ties together all Hotspots on the Helium Network. What this enables is several very powerful capabilities that set the Helium Network apart from other network providers with LoRaWAN support. 

* **Device Roaming** - Any device on the Helium Network can connect to any Hotspot and expect the utilize the same feature set and capabilities. 
* **Microtransactions** - Using [Data Credits](/blockchain/tokens#data-credits), Network users can pay for device traffic at the packet level. 
* **Seamless Onboarding** - Easily onboard LoRaWAN-enabled devices without additional configurations or third-party assistance.


## LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a MAC-layer specification for sending data wirelessly from devices over long ranges while using very little battery. Any LoRaWAN-compatible device can send data through the Helium Network and take advantage of the LongFi architecture.
