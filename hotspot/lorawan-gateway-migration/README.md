# LoRaWAN Gateway Migration

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hotspot_migration.png)

In this section, we’ll go over some off-the-shelf LoRaWAN gateways that Helium has tested and vetted, along with the steps to configure them to serve as hotspots on the Helium Network. This page will be updated as we continue to test more gateways.

**LoRaWAN Gateways:**

* [Laird Sentrius RG191](laird.md)
* [Tektelic KONA](tektelic-kona.md)
* [MultiTech Conduit](multitech-conduit.md)
* [MikroTik wAP LR8 / LR9](mikrotik-wAP_LR89.md)
